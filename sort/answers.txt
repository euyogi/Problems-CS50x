sort1 uses: Bubble sort.

How do you know?: It's times were close to sort3, but in the sorted file
it was very very fast, showing that it's probably bubble, because when sorted
it just needs to check the sequence one time, as it won't need to do swaps.

sort2 uses: Merge sort.

How do you know?: It's times were the fastest and stablest even for the
largest files, showing that it's probably merge, because it handles very good with long sequences.

sort3 uses: Selection sort.

How do you know?: By elimination, and it's times were very stable, showing that it doesn't care
if it's already sorted or no, it needs a certain amount of steps to conclude that it's sorted
but it was slower than sort2, so it's not merge sort.
